# Dictionary Popup Extension

## Description
For many non-native English speakers, reading content online can sometimes be challenging due to unfamiliar words. Whether you're reading a simple recipe or an article related to your job or studies, encountering a word you don't know can disrupt your flow and concentration.

The Dictionary Popup Chrome Extension is designed to alleviate this common issue. Instead of opening a new tab and searching for a word's meaning, this extension allows you to quickly and effortlessly see the definition of any word directly on the webpage you are reading.
